# Bayesian-Nonparametric-Mixture-Models
This repository contains the codes for infinite mixture models. The first one is the generative model for infinite mixture model induced by 
dirichlet process as described in (Ferguson, 2005). The second infinite mixture model have the property of microclustering as explained
in (Betancourt et al., 2016).
DP.m -> Generative model for dirichlet processs infinte mixture model explained in (Ferguson, 2005)
Micro_Clust.m -> A gibbs sampling algorithm for microclustering infinte mixture model as explained in (Betancourt et al., 2016).
